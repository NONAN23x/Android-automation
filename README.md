# Android-automation


This project isn't perfect, but should work really well once its finished :)


The repository conatins python program which has to be integrated with "Termux" (android app) to function.
Termux is a linux emulator for android devices and is a perfect way to start learning linux on the go
This code makes use of the functionality of termux which gives the freedom to make system calls using some commands
So, I thought maybe automate android by requesting system calls using python and hence, brag about "Mobile Automation" :)
Keep in mind that you may need to acquire wavelock when initialising the program
